Our goal is twofold: 1) we estimate the prevalence of mocks in extant test suites; and 2) we estimate how often it would be difficult to use alternatives to mocks (e.g. stubs).

percentage of classes being mocked (classes as mock subjects; how many distinct implementations of classes; how many tests have mocks)

is it the case that tests in package X are more likely to use real objects from X and mock objects from Y? Does it make sense to compute a notion of distance between X and Y? (e.g. you mock a database which is “far away” but not something close by)
how much dependence from main code and how much dependence from test case?

what is the lifetime of a mock object? does it survive across tests (in a field), or is it created just within a test? (compare to non-mocks)

What things are hard to mock?
