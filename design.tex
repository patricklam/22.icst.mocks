Mock objects~\cite{beck02:_test_driven_devel} are commonly used in
unit tests for object-oriented systems.  They allow developers to test objects that 
rely on other objects, particularly ones that are hard 
to build (e.g. databases; or that come from different components).

While mock objects are an invaluable tool for developers, their use




also complicates the static analysis of test case source code. 
Such static analyses can help IDEs provide better
support to test case writers; enable better static estimation of test coverage
(avoiding mocks); and detect focal methods in test cases. While researchers have
proposed techniques for automatically generating mocks~\cite{alshahwan10:_autom,fazzini20:_framew_autom_test_mockin_mobil_apps}, our goal here is the opposite:
we detect mocks that already exist in test cases.
