Some discussion here.


Threat to validity: Java versus C\#.

\todo[inline]{yet in C\# mocking is done completely different. Moq is the popular framework and it does mocking via inheritance (not bytecode manipulation). It can only mock interfaces and class methods that are virtual (can be overridden by a subclass). 
so back to your statement.. if in C\# mocking is done mostly for things that can be easily stubbed (unless they have too many methods) why is mocking popular there?}
